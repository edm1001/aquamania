It is highly valued for its ability to consume algae in aquariums, making it a natural solution for algae control. Young Chinese Algae Eaters are usually peaceful and can be a helpful addition to a community tank. However, as they mature, they can become more territorial and aggressive, particularly towards other bottom-dwelling fish. This aggressive behavior makes it essential to provide them with ample space and hiding spots. These fish are known for their elongated bodies and sucker mouths, which they use to cling to surfaces and scrape off algae. They prefer aquariums with plenty of rocks, driftwood, and plants where they can find shelter and food. Despite their name, they should not be relied upon solely for algae control and need a varied diet, including algae wafers and vegetables. Chinese Algae Eaters can grow up to 6 inches (15 cm) in length and are best kept in larger tanks to accommodate their size and activity level. They are generally recommended for intermediate aquarists due to their specific care requirements.",
